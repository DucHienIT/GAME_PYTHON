# RPG Adventure 2D

This is a 2D role-playing game (RPG) built in Python using the Pygame library. The game features a hero who must navigate through a series of levels, defeat enemies, and collect treasures to ultimately defeat the final boss.

## Features

- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- Different types of enemies with unique abilities and strengths.
- Treasure chests that contain items to aid the hero in battle.
- Boss fights that test the hero's skills and strategy.
- A save and load feature to allow players to pick up where they left off.

## Getting Started

To use this application, you need to have Python 3 and Pygame installed on your computer. Clone the repository and open the project in your preferred Python IDE. Run the main.py file to start the game.

```
python main.py
```

## How to Play

The hero can be moved using the arrow keys or WASD keys. The spacebar is used to attack enemies. The hero has a health bar that depletes as they take damage. If the hero loses all their health, the game is over.

The levels are completed by defeating all the enemies and collecting the treasure chest at the end. The final level is the boss fight, where the hero must defeat the final boss to win the game.
